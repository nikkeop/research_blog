/* The custom cursor — data/settings.yaml `customcursor`. What is drawn lives
   in `css/customcursor.css`; this file only steers it.

   The dot chases the pointer rather than sitting on it: each frame closes a
   tenth of the remaining distance, the theme's damping at this frame rate.
   The chase only runs while there is distance left to close — once the dot
   has caught up it snaps the last half pixel and the loop ends, until the
   mouse moves again. The dot is its own fixed element, placed with a
   transform, so a frame costs the compositor one moved layer and never a
   restyle or relayout of the page. It hides until the mouse first moves,
   while the mouse rests (three seconds) and while the page scrolls; over
   anything whose computed cursor is `pointer` — how the theme marks
   clickable — it swells into a ring.

   Only a fine pointer gets one, since on touch there is no pointer to trail,
   and `prefers-reduced-motion` turns it off wholesale: a dot easing after the
   mouse is exactly the decoration that setting asks to lose. Nothing here
   touches the native cursor, which stays visible throughout. */
