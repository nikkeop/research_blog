You are currently looking at the v2 version. This version has a completely different way how the bricks work. They are no longer shortcodes. Bricks are now parts of the content, seperated by three minus signs (an horizontal ruler in markdown). The name of the brick can be put behind the minuses like this: `---.wide`. However, there is also a rule set that automatically recognizes each brick, making the explicit casting of the bricks obsolete. The goal of this change is to make the content easier to edit and to cause less build errors. The new version also supports Kramdown-style custom classes in images and links.

Hugobricks is aiming to be the Ultimate Hugo Theme... and this v2 version is another step in that direction. If you want to learn more about the philosophy behind Hugobricks, please read the [readme file](https://github.com/jhvanderschee/hugobricks_v2#readme) in the repository.
